# PNG_to_Bitmap

This is a program that translates a black and white image to a "bitmap" (an array of bits in '0bXXXXXXXX' format where *X* is either a 1 or a 0) to be used with a SSD1306 arduino module.

For a single file:  
`PNG_to_Bitmap.exe test_image.png`  

For multiple files:  
`PNG_to_Bitmap.exe test_image.png test_image2.png`  

The output is an 'output.txt' file

There are some test images inside the folder 'img_examples'
